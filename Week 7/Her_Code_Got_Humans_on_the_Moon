Hamilton’s outstanding achievement as a working mother is that, in the male-dominated field of computer programming, she not only survived but also succeeded—she managed to become an expert and the leader of the project and won important technical arguments with her teammates. In the early days of software engineering, when programming was not even considered to be a woman’s job, Hamilton not only accomplished her work but also designed her program with great rigor. Her rigorous approach to programming, in my opinion, was her more important achievement as a computer science pioneer than her contribution to the concept of software engineering. In the days when primitive computers ran on punch cards and software was still a wilderness, Hamilton already had the foresight to realize how a small bug that might never happen could easily destroy the whole system. To make sure that she her software was always reliable and prepared for emergency scenarios, Hamilton insisted on adding protections to her program such as error-checking code, recovery mechanisms, and the flexibility of prioritizing jobs. These rigorous designs are all models that even modern software engineers should still follow.
